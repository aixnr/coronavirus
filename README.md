# Coronavirus

This repo, `aixnr/coronavirus`, is my collection of notes on coronaviruses and COVID-19.. It can be accessed through this address: [cov.aizan.science](https://cov.aizan.science/). It uses static content generator `hugo` ([more on that here](https://gohugo.io/)) to compile into a website.

If you are interested to build the website yourself, clone this repo and run `hugo`.

```sh
# clone
git clone https://github.com/aixnr/coronavirus.git

# change directory into the repo
cd coronavirus

# serve locally
hugo serve

# compile into static html
hugo
```

I license this work under [CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). If you found anything worth adding to the notes, please email me at `aizanfahri[at]gmail[dot]com`, or open an issue here, or tweet/DM me `@aixnr`. I will not be accepting any pull request.

Stay healthy, stay safe, and stay sane.
