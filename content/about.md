My name is Aizan, I am a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Rochester Medical Center, currently undergoing training in the fields of influenza virology and B cell immunology under the mentorship of Dr. David Topham and Dr. Mark Sangster. I am affiliated with the David H. Smith Center of Vaccine Biology and Immunology (CVBI) and New York Influenza Center of Excellence (NYICE).

This small project was born out of frustration trying to catch the endless and rapid stream of information on COVID-19 and coronaviruses. The first iteration of this project was a simple Markdown `.md` document on my private GitHub repository located at `aixnr/coronavirus` (now a public repo). A fellow scientist suggested that I should turn this into a *blog format* to facilitate sharing, so here we are.

In addition to the information on the home page, I have 2 more pages

* [Category I Information]({{< relref "category-one.md" >}}), which contains list of papers that I would like to read.
* [Category II Information]({{< relref "category-two.md" >}}), which contains links to new releases categorized under a number of different sections.

Feel free to reach me through my personal email, `aizanfahri(at)gmail(dot)com` or tweet/DM me on Twitter `@aixnr`, so open an issue on `aixnr/coronavirus`. As stated on the home page, I will not  accept pull request on this repository.

Anyway, it is not that I am reading all these materials so that you do not have to, I am reading all these because I wanted to and I encourage you to do the same thing.
