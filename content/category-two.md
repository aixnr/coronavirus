The main page is what I call as the **Category I** content, listing critical information. This page is for specific niche content that would be useful to construct narratives, therefore designated as the **Category II** content.

## Philanthropy in Public Health

Let's take a note who are spending money to fight the outbreak.

## Failure of Public Health Response

We will briefly talk about failure of response due to lack of awareness by government, downplaying the risk, or just having incompetent politicians that failed to safely steer country out of trouble.

## The Vulnerable Populations

When disaster happens, vulnerable populations would get hit the hardest. We need to know them, be aware of their pain, and try to help as much whenever possible.

## Clusters and Local Index Cases

It would be interesting to analyze local index cases. It is a chance to learn human behavior where we would have chance to bump into lack of common sense.

## Lockdown and Restriction of Movement

Entries here would be skewed to reports from my country (Malaysia) and United States (country I currently reside in), and probably some regions in Europe (because they got into news faster) than other countries in different regions.

## Keeping the Economy Running

Coronavirus is not the *de facto* force that's responsible for the economic recession. However, no doubt that it plays a major factor.
