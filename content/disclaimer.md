## Please Be Careful

We are living in strange time. While fighting this coronavirus pandemic, we are also fighting another war, the so-called *infodemic*. Suffice it to say, truth is a lot less exciting, a lot more boring, not juicy, unattractive, and complicated. Conspiracy theories, on the other hand, tend to feed on fear and prejudice.

To quote [Alberto Brandolini (2013)](https://twitter.com/ziobrando/status/289635060758507521), 

> The amount of energy necessary to refute bullshit is an order of magnitude bigger than to produce it.

If you received any claim, remember these:

1. Ask yourself "Should I immediately believe this?"
2. Then, ask yourself "is this coming from people that has knowledge of the field", where the field here refers to, not in any particular order:
    * Virology
    * Immunology
    * Healthcare
    * Epidemiology
    * Biomedical
3. Do not, under any circumstances, disseminate false claims. That is the least cool thing to do.
